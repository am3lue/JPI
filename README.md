## 💡 About the Project

**JPI (Julia Package Installer)** is a fast, intuitive, and colorful command-line helper built with **pure Bash**, designed to make Julia package management simple for everyone.  

While Julia’s built-in `Pkg` REPL is powerful, it can feel complex for new users.  
**JPI** bridges that gap with a friendly interface that feels like `apt` or `npm`, but for Julia!
